# ER-diagrams
#I had to create a diagram with drawio program for a library system where there are books, authors and library members. Each book has one title, ISBN and can have several authors. Each author has a name and a unique identifier. Each library member has a name and a unique identifier. Books can be borrowed by library member.

#After I had to create a DB with tables and their relationships. Fill all tables with appropriate information. Make an SQL query that joins all tables and retrieves relevant info. For example, get all books from author 1, along with the members who are currently borrowing these books.
